# StateDistancesInKm
JSON file of calculated state distances in km. Goes through each state and compares distances to other states
This was created to have a goto reference for getting any state distance through a cached JSON object

You can find my method of calculation from this project: https://codepen.io/Jadog/pen/wvgPmaM
Feel free to fork and modify to just get whatever state you may need. This is used for my project in calculated static distances between states to determine fair sharing
of shipping machines for different locations.
